Adding function to class and call it from main
I created a function in TCPserver called void printServerMenu();
I added void printServerMenu(); to the TCPServer HEADER file
I added #include <iostream>  so member functions can use std::cout
Inside void printServerMenu I added 5 lines of text to display to the screen
I added server.printServerMenu() to server_main so that the function is executed

The approach for this assignment
- Set up a listner on the server (geeks for geeks echo server)
- connect to the lister, and display the server menu 
- user selects option from the menu, server responds

server should be a single-process non-blocking server that can accept multiple concurrent
